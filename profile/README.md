## About Longclaw

**Longclaw** is a software engineering organization focused on building **robust, scalable, and mission-critical systems** for environments where reliability matters most.

Inspired by endurance, reach, and precision, our work is designed to:
- Cut through complex problem spaces
- Operate reliably in harsh, high-load conditions
- Scale across distributed and real-time architectures

We build software that lasts — just like the blade we’re named after.




## 🧭 Vision

To build software that can be trusted in critical domains —  
**from the skies above to the seas below.**
